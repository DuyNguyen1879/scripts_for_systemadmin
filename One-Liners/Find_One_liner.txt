    # Find has a partiularly powerful mechanism, -exec,
    # which lets you execute commands on a per-file
    # basis, while being selective about the files you're operating on.
    # Lets say we want to delete all the *.bak or *.backup
    # files which are older than 30 days.
    # Type the following all on 1 line.
    $ find . ( -name '*.bak' -o -name *.backup ) -type f -atime +30 -exec rm '{}' ;
    # It would be even better if we only deleted
    # the *.bak file if the original file was still
    # available. In this case, we can use csh and test to help
    # Type the following all on 1 line.
    $ find . ( -name '*.bak' -o -name *.backup ) -type f -atime +30 -exec csh -c 'if ( -f $1:r ) rm $1' '{}' ;
    # or if you're really paraniod, use 'test -s'
    # to verify that the original file has not been truncated
    # Type the following all on 1 line.
